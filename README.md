#Data Structures Projects

## `sourcecode.jar`
This jar file `sourcecode.jar` is from the text <cite>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</cite> ([companion site](http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&itemId=1118771338&bcsId=8635)). It contains source code for the various examples in the text (including test classes that aren&rsquo;t published in the text itself).

## High Scores
A Java application that stores a list of video game high scores (source: <cite>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</cite>, p. 104).

## Insertion Sort
A Java application that sorts an array of characters, i.e., takes as argument an unordered array of characters and rearranges them into nondecreasing order (&ldquo;nondecreasing&rdquo; basically means increasing with possible ties). This application uses the insertion-sort algorithm (source: <cite>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</cite>, p. 111).
