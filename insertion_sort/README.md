## Project Description
A Java application that sorts an array of characters, i.e., takes as argument an unordered array of characters and rearranges them into nondecreasing order (&ldquo;nondecreasing&rdquo; basically means increasing with possible ties). This application uses the insertion-sort algorithm (source: <cite>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</cite>, p. 111).
